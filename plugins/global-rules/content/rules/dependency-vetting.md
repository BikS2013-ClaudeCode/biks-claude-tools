# Dependency Vetting

> Personal working rule, loaded in every project via `~/.claude/rules`.
> Formerly the `<dependency-vetting>` section of the replicated
> `<structure-and-conventions>` block.

- Before adding ANY new runtime dependency to a project (`package.json`, `pyproject.toml`, `go.mod`, etc.), you MUST verify the version you are about to pin is free of known security advisories. Apply this rule especially to:
  - **Browser/embedded-engine packages:** `electron`, `puppeteer`, `playwright`, `chromium`, `webview2` — they ship with full browser engines and accumulate CVEs fast.
  - **Test/build toolchains:** `vitest`, `vite`, `esbuild`, `webpack`, `rollup`, `parcel` — frequent dev-server-RCE advisories with transitive impact.
  - **Network/proxy libraries:** `node-http-proxy`, `http-proxy-3`, `proxy-chain`, `axios`, `node-fetch`, `request`, `got`, `undici`.
  - **Cryptography / auth libraries:** `jsonwebtoken`, `jose`, `bcrypt`, `node-forge`, `crypto-js`.

- Vetting procedure (run BEFORE writing the dependency into the manifest):
  1. Identify the latest stable major version available on the registry (e.g. `npm view <pkg> versions --json | tail -10` or `pnpm info <pkg> versions --json`).
  2. Check the package's security advisory page (GitHub Advisory Database, npmjs.com vulnerability tab, or `npm audit --package <pkg>@<version> --json`) for the candidate version.
  3. If the candidate version has unfixed advisories at HIGH severity or above, bump to the next non-vulnerable major (or, if no such version exists, surface the trade-off to the user via AskUserQuestion before proceeding).
  4. Pin to a caret range against the verified clean version (e.g. `"electron": "^39.8.5"`, not `"electron": "^38"`).
  5. Record the vetted-on date in a one-line comment in `Issues - Pending Items.md` under a "Dependency vetting log" section so future audits can date the decision.

- For ESPECIALLY fast-moving packages (`electron`, `vite`, `vitest`, `esbuild`), ALWAYS pull the latest stable major even when a reference implementation uses an older one. The reference's version is informational, not authoritative — verify it is still on a supported branch before adopting it verbatim.

- After installing, ALWAYS run the project's audit command (`pnpm audit`, `npm audit`, `pip-audit`, `cargo audit`, `go list -m -u -json all | nancy sleuth`, etc.) and confirm the advisory count is zero before marking the scaffolding step complete. Treat any HIGH-or-above advisory as a blocker; surface it before continuing.

- When a transitive dependency carries an advisory that the direct dependency has not yet fixed (e.g. `vitest@1` pulling `vite@5` with a CVE), use the package manager's override mechanism (`pnpm.overrides`, `npm overrides`, `yarn resolutions`, `cargo [patch]`) to force the fixed transitive version, AND document the override in `Issues - Pending Items.md` with its expiry condition (i.e. "remove this override once direct-dep X reaches version Y").
